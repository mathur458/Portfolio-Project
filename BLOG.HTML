    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p>When we consider technology, we tend to envision greater processors, more intelligent AI, and mind-bending graphics. But what if I told you technology is assisting us in accessing senses we didn't realize we possessed?

            You've likely heard of the five primary senses—<b>sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell</b>—but science indicates there are up to <b>33 senses</b>, and technology is now assisting us in boosting or even re-discovering some of them in mind-blowing manners.
            </p>
        
        <h4>The Sense of Microorganisms</h4>
        <p>Ever get a sense you're going to be sick before symptoms appear? Well, it turns out this could be more than in your mind—humans might have an uncalled ability to sense bacteria and viruses, and AI is coming to assist us in accessing it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wearable sensors are being developed to monitor chemical fluctuations in your body before you become sick.</li>
            <li>AI-powered "electronic noses" are already detecting diseases such as cancer and COVID-19 sooner than standard tests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magnetoreception: The Superpower You Didn't Know You Had</h4>
        <p>Birds and sharks are able to detect the magnetic field of the Earth and use it for navigation. But do humans possess the ability as well?

            Scientists discovered small magnetite crystals in the human brain—the same material that guides birds during migration.
            Some research indicates that we may intuitively feel magnetic fields, but we've lost the conscious perception of them.</p>

        <p>Tech implants are now being designed that may give us back this lost sense so we can navigate like living GPS devices!</p>

        <h4>Hearing Wi-Fi & Feeling the Internet</h4>
        <p>What if you heard Wi-Fi or sensed the internet without a screen? Believe it or not, some people already do.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cyborg artist Neil Harbisson carries an antenna embedded in his skull that enables him to "hear" colors via vibrations.</li>
            <li>Scientists are developing sensory devices that could allow us to feel radio waves, Wi-Fi signals, or even stock market trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Soon, we may be sporting technology that hooks directly into our nervous system, providing us with completely new senses we never thought we'd possess.</p>

        <h4>The Future: What If Technology Unlocks "Impossible" Senses?</h4>
        <p>Human senses have their limitations—our eyes can't detect infrared light, ears can't perceive ultrasonic noises, or brain can't feel magnetic fields the way some creatures can.</p>
        <p>But what when technology eliminates those boundaries? Will humans of the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>See in the dark like owls?</li>
            <li>Sense impending doom like sharks?</li>
            <li>Hear radio waves live?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Perhaps technology won't redefine the world—maybe it'll transform us.</p>
